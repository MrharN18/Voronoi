# Dynamic Voronoi Diagrams in the Hilbert Metric

A dynamic visualization software for Voronoi diagrams in the Hilbert metric on user specified convex polygons based on https://github.com/caesardai/Voronoi_In_Hilbert/tree/main.

## Overview
This repository contains an extension of the software used for drawing Voronoi diagrams in the Hilbert metric. It improves the existing software by adding options for regular polygons and lattices.

## Installation and run
To edit the source code on your local machine you need link:https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/javase8-archive-downloads.html[Java8] and link:https://processing.org/download[processing2.2.1]

To run simply download double click the "HilbertVoronoi.jar" icon or navigate to the directory that contains the jar file and run the below command

```bash
java -jar HilbertVoronoiv0.1.0-alpha.jar
```
You should see below window when launched successfully

## Usage

* First select **Insert Convex** and create a polygon by hand or pick one of the relugar polygons from the drop down menus

* Next we have to choose points inside the polygon
  - If you want to choose points by hand, first choose **Brute-Force Voronoi** or **Fast Voronoi** from the menu and start selecting points in the interior of the polygon
  - If you want to choose a pre-existing lattice, choose one from the drop down menu before selecting one of the two aforementioned options (do this once the lattice is done drawing)
