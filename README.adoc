# Dynamic Voronoi Diagrams in the Hilbert Metric

A dynamic visualization software for Voronoi diagrams in the Hilbert metric on user specified convex polygons based on https://github.com/caesardai/Voronoi_In_Hilbert/tree/main.

## Overview
This repository contains an extension of the software used for drawing Voronoi diagrams in the Hilbert metric. It improves the existing link:https://github.com/caesardai/Voronoi_In_Hilbert/tree/main[software] by adding options for regular polygons and lattices.

## Installation and run
To edit the source code on your local machine you need link:https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/javase8-archive-downloads.html[Java8] and link:https://processing.org/download[processing2.2.1]

To run simply download and double click the "HilbertVoronoi.jar" icon or navigate to the directory that contains the jar file and run the below command

```bash
java -jar HilbertVoronoiv0.1.0-alpha.jar
```
You should see below window when launched successfully

## Usage

* First select **Insert Convex** and create a polygon by hand or pick one of the relugar polygons from the drop down menus

* Next choose points on the interior of the polygon
  - If you want to choose points by hand, first select **Brute-Force Voronoi** or **Fast Voronoi** from the menu and start adding points on the interior of the polygon
  - If you want to choose a pre-existing lattice, select one from the drop down menu before selecting one of the two aforementioned options (do this once the lattice is finished drawing)
